# Assignment: Responsive Web Design

## Objective:
Create a responsive webpage using modern CSS techniques, specifically Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries. The goal is to ensure the webpage adapts gracefully to various screen sizes.

## Assignment Tasks

### Designing a Responsive Layout
a. Create a webpage with the following sections:

Header (including a logo and navigation links).
Main content area (with two columns: one for text content and the other for an image).
Footer (with links to social media and a copyright notice).
b. Use Flexbox to style the navigation menu in the header.
c. Use CSS Grid to structure the main content area.

### Creating Media Queries for Responsiveness
a. Implement media queries to ensure the webpage looks good on the following screen sizes:

Small screens (up to 600px): Stack all sections vertically.
Medium screens (601px to 1024px): Keep the header and footer horizontal, but stack the main content columns.
Large screens (above 1024px): Display the layout as designed with Flexbox and Grid.

### Bonus

Add animations or transitions when resizing the screen.
